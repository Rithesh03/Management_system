<p><font size=4>An integrated system combines project management or project planning, with many other aspects of company life. For example, projects can have tracking issues assigned to each project, the list of project customers becomes a customer   relationship module, and each person on the project plan has their own task lists, calendars, and messaging functionality associated with their projects. Similarly, specialized tools like source Forge integrate project management software with source control software and bug-tracking software, so that each piece of information can be integrated into the same system. Some organizations are just getting started with project management. Others have reached a level of maturity whereby project management has become a way of life. In the leading organizations, project management is aligned with and integratedinto the company’s business goals and objectives. No longer, the individual responsibility of the project manager, top management is taking more responsibility for driving the company’s project management strategies.<br>
This project entitled “Integrated Project Management and Controlling System” aims at managing all project related information, handling project documentation and communication between all team members. At the same time project manager and controller need current information about the utilization of team members and the caused costs at all time. All team members should be informed of project changes to avoid time-consuming enquiries. Changes to the project documentation should be possible easily and from everywhere. As projects  become more and more complex, there is  a high demand in managing all project related information, handling project documentation and communication between all team members. However there is a lack of a comprehensive tool which will help us manage project related information between all team members simultaneously.</font></p><br><br>
